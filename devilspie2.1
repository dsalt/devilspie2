.SH NAME
Devilspie2 - perform scripted actions on windows as they are created
.SH Description
.B Devilspie2
is a program that detects windows as they are created and performs scripted
actions on them. The scripts are written in Lua, allowing a great deal of
customisation.

More details in /usr/share/doc/devilspie2/README.

.SH Options
.IP "\-\-version"
Displays the version of Devilspie2.
.IP "\-\-folder folder"
Sets the folder where the Lua scripts are loaded from.
.IP "\-\-debug"
Shows debug information from the Lua scripts. If debug_print is used in the Lua
scripts, that output will only be printed to stdout if this option is used.
.IP "\-\-emulate"
Emulation mode. This prevents windows from being affected by the scripts,
but window positions etc. can still be read.
.IP "\-\-wnck\-version"
Show the version of libwnck in use. (Only available on GTK3 or later.)
