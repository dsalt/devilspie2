.SH NAME
Devilspie2 \- perform scripted actions on windows when certain events occur
.SH Description
.P
.B Devilspie2
is a program that detects windows as they are created, gain or lose focus or
have their titles changed, and performs scripted actions on them. The
scripts are written in \fILua\fR, allowing a great deal of customisation.

.SH Options
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version
Displays the version of Devilspie2.
.TP
\fB\-f \fIfolder\fR, \fB\-\-folder \fIfolder
Sets the folder where the Lua scripts are loaded from.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug
Shows debug information from the Lua scripts. If \fIdebug_print\fR is used
in the Lua scripts, it will output to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-debug\-fifo
Copy stdout & send debug info to a FIFO. If \fIdebug_print\fR is used in
the Lua scripts, it will output to the FIFO.

Nothing is output to the FIFO if nothing is reading it.
You can read it using a program such as \fBcat\fR.

\fB\-\-debug\fR and \fB\-\-debug\-fifo\fR may be used together.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-print\-fifo
Print the FIFO's file name then exit.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-emulate
Emulation mode. This prevents windows from being affected by the scripts,
but window positions etc. can still be read.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-wnck\-version
Show the version of libwnck in use. (Only available on GTK3 or later.)
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-lua\-version
Show the version of Lua in use.

See

environment variables are set is used.
