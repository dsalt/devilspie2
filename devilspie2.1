Devilspie2 \- perform scripted actions on windows when certain events occur
.SH Description
.P
.B Devilspie2
is a program that detects windows as they are created, gain or lose focus or
have their titles changed, and performs scripted actions on them. The
scripts are written in \fILua\fR, allowing a great deal of customisation.

Sets the folder where the Lua scripts are loaded from.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug
Shows debug information from the Lua scripts. If debug_print is used in the Lua
scripts, that output will only be printed to stdout if this option is used.
